# fforge-core

Layer 2 of the fforge workspace: the deterministic simulation core, consuming
`fforge-domain`. The crate is a pure fold over an append-only event log — `GameState`
*is* the fold's accumulator, `Session` glues log + state + observers together, and
`commands::step` is the only place proposals turn into recorded events. Currently
building the Phase 1 walking skeleton (DESIGN.md §9): a full season loop, league table,
and a deliberately crude Poisson match engine.

## Module map

| Module | Owns |
|---|---|
| `event` | `Event` enum — the append-only log's payload types |
| `state` | `GameState` — pure fold (`apply`/`replay`), `TableRow`, `league_table()` |
| `commands` | `Command` enum, `step()` — validates a proposal and produces the events for it |
| `session` | `Session` — owns the log + folded state, routes commands, notifies observers; `save_log`/`load_log` (JSON-lines) |
| `observer` | `EventObserver` trait, `SeasonTelemetry` — passive event-stream consumers (trace/telemetry spine) |
| `match_engine` | Phase-1 crude engine: `lineup_strength`, `simulate_match` (Poisson), `ai_pick_lineup` |
| `rng` | Seeded xoshiro256** + `derive_stream` — the crate's only source of randomness |
| `schedule` | `double_round_robin()` — deterministic fixture generation |
| `worldgen` | `generate()` — seeded new-game world/schedule/start date, recorded once into `GameStarted` |

`lib.rs` re-exports the public surface; consumers (`fforge-game`) import from the crate
root.

## Invariants to preserve

1. **All randomness is seed-derived.** Every `Rng` comes from `rng::derive_stream(seed,
   tag)`. Never construct a shared/global `Rng`, never seed from system entropy or wall-
   clock time — that breaks the same-seed-same-season guarantee the test suite checks.
2. **`GameState::apply` (and therefore `replay`) is a total, pure fold.** No RNG, no I/O,
   no wall-clock branching inside it. All impure work — RNG draws, match simulation,
   validation — happens in `commands::step`, which only *produces* `Event`s for `apply`
   to consume.
