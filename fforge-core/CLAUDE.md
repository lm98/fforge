# fforge-core

Layer 2 of the fforge workspace: the deterministic simulation core, consuming
`fforge-domain`. The crate is a pure fold over an append-only event log — `GameState`
*is* the fold's accumulator, `Session` glues log + state + observers together, and
`commands::step` is the only place proposals turn into recorded events.

## Current phase

Phase 1 (full season loop, league table) is complete. `match_engine` runs the Phase 2a
event-based possession engine (`MATCH_MODEL.md`), replacing the old crude Poisson engine
behind the same `play_match` call site, calibrated and guarded by
`match_engine::calibrate`/`bin/calibrate`.

Phase 3 player development (`DEVELOPMENT_MODEL.md`) is implemented in the `development`
module — a monthly `Event::DevelopmentTick` records resolved attribute deltas the fold
integer-adds, and `Command::StartNextSeason` rolls the developed world into a fresh
season — calibrated and guarded by the `career_arc` harness/`bin/career_arc`.

Phase 4 (`TRANSFER_MODEL.md`) is complete end to end. The event-log seam (§4) adds six
events (`TransferCompleted`, `PlayerReleased`, `ContractRenewed`, `YouthIntake`,
`PlayerRetired`, `FinanceTick`) and their `state::apply` fold arms. The Layer-3 club
decision AI (§6, §6.1) is implemented in `club_ai` — a `ClubPolicy` trait and its v1
`UtilityPolicy` implementation, producing `TransferDecision`s from a `ClubObservation`.
`market::resolve_window` runs §5's simultaneous, deferred-acceptance clearing loop over
`club_ai`'s decisions and folds winning bids into `Event::TransferCompleted`;
`commands::advance_matchday` fires it on the §7 window boundaries (summer/winter), the
same tick mechanism development and finance use — no new command. The player pool
closes at both ends (§8) via the `pool` module: annual youth intake and age/CA-driven
retirement, both firing at the summer window alongside the market. Deferred beyond v1:
human transfer decisions (§10), loans, negotiation rounds, transfer clauses. The
Phase-4 pathology harness (§11) is implemented in `market::calibrate`
(`MarketTelemetry`/`MarketReport`, `bin/market.rs`, `market_is_in_a_believable_ballpark`)
— the transfer-market sibling of `match_engine::calibrate` and `career_arc`. It drove
the re-fit of `ValueKnobs::beta` (ln2/6 → ln2/8) and `FinanceKnobs::revenue_per_reputation`
(150k → 500k) recorded in `TRANSFER_MODEL.md` §9; the harness caught the market at those
starting values dead (universal insolvency, ~0.2 transfers/club/window).

`fforge-core` is the active development front.

## Module map

| Module | Owns |
|---|---|
| `event` | `Event` enum — the append-only log's payload types, including the Phase-4 transfer/contract/finance/pool events (`TRANSFER_MODEL.md` §4) |
| `market` | Phase-4 clearing loop and window mechanics (`TRANSFER_MODEL.md` §5, §7): `resolve_window` — freeze the valuation cache once, then simultaneous rounds of `club_ai`-decided bids/listings, contention resolved by the selling club's ranking (fee, buyer reputation, `ClubId`) then player consent (`MarketKnobs`'s wage/reputation-threshold roll), refused pairs never re-proposed (classic deferred acceptance — the actual convergence mechanism; `MAX_ROUNDS = 12` is the adversarial-input cap, not the normal exit). Returns `WindowOutcome { transfers, rejected_bids, valuations, unfilled_needs, rounds_used }` — only `transfers` folds into `Event::TransferCompleted`; the rest is a Trace, exactly `MatchOutcome.stream`'s shape (`MATCH_MODEL.md` §7). `summer_window_close`/`winter_window_close` derive window boundaries from the season (never day-of-year constants); `commands::transfer_window_events` fires resolution when `advance_matchday` crosses one, using `TRANSFER_STREAM_NS \| window_index` as its RNG stream. Its `calibrate` submodule (re-exported at `market::{MarketTelemetry, MarketReport, run_market_calibration, print_report}`) is the §11 pathology harness: since `WindowOutcome`'s rich Trace never survives the fold, `MarketTelemetry` reads competitive-balance/financial-health metrics off the folded `World` at each season boundary (`record_season_end`, via `state::league_table` and `valuation::value_all`) while consuming `TransferCompleted`/`YouthIntake`/etc. as an `EventObserver` for fee/volume data — pooled over many seeds × ~15 seasons, exactly the multi-seed-pooling discipline `career_arc` and `match_engine::calibrate` established. Harness plumbing only; never feeds back into `ValueKnobs`/`FinanceKnobs` by itself |
| `club_ai` | Phase-4 Layer-3 club decision AI (`TRANSFER_MODEL.md` §6, §6.1): the `ClubPolicy` trait (`ClubObservation` in, `Vec<TransferDecision>` out — the Gym-shaped seam `ai_pick_lineup`'s doc comment anticipated), `UtilityPolicy` (`need(club, role)` = depth + quality-vs-own-reputation-target + succession risk from `valuation::project_ca_batch`; buy shortlists ranked by `need · (value − asking_price)`; sell lists from §6's first two triggers plus a third, squad-size pressure term — `UtilityKnobs::squad_pressure_start`/`_exponent`/`_max_listings` — that makes at-template (not yet genuinely surplus) roles listable through a bounded, continuously-growing quota as the squad approaches `squad_max`, addressing the §9 "squads pin at the ceiling" residual; GK is excluded from this term since its template sits only one above `min_goalkeepers`), and `observe()` (builds a `ClubObservation` off `World` + the `value_all` cache — the only place in this module that reads `World`). Squad bounds `[18, 30]`, `≥2` GK, cash and wage headroom are hard stabilizers, not utility terms — the pressure term never touches them. **`UtilityKnobs::asking_markup` must stay `<= 1.0`**: with every club pricing off the same omniscient `value()` (§2.6 — no private valuations in v1), an ask *above* value makes `need · (value − asking_price)` negative for every buyer regardless of need, so no trade can ever clear — filed as a corrected divergence from §12 item 6's literal "markup" phrasing, caught by `club_ai::tests::real_observed_candidates_can_actually_produce_a_bid`. Decisions only — the clearing loop lives in `market` |
| `state` | `GameState` — pure fold (`apply`/`replay`), `TableRow`, `league_table()`. The six Phase-4 fold arms are pure integer operations only (no RNG, no math beyond addition, no engine calls) and keep club rosters sorted after mutation, so replay-path equality holds. `apply_transfer_completed`/`apply_finance_deltas` are `pub(crate)` free functions so `market`/`commands` can apply the identical mutation to a working `World` without a second encoding |
| `commands` | `Command` enum, `step()` — validates a proposal and produces the events for it; `player_match_preview()` — a pure query, re-deriving the same lineup selection and RNG stream `advance_matchday` is about to use, for live-viewing the human's own fixture before it's recorded. `dev_ticks_between` returns its compounded working `World` alongside the events, so `transfer_window_events` (fired from `advance_matchday` on a §7 boundary crossing) resolves against this advance's developed attributes and finance deltas, not the pre-tick world; `season_start_date` derives the season's kickoff from `state.date`/`current_matchday` rather than storing it |
| `session` | `Session` — owns the log + folded state, routes commands, notifies observers; `save_log`/`load_log` (JSON-lines) |
| `observer` | `EventObserver` trait, `SeasonTelemetry` — passive event-stream consumers (trace/telemetry spine) |
| `match_engine` | Phase-2a engine: `play_match` (`MatchOutcome { home_goals, away_goals, stream }`), `lineup_strength`, `ai_pick_lineup`. Submodules: `zone` (five-zone state + role→zone presence table), `knobs` (the fitted `Knobs` table), `contest` (attribute→contest maps, the logistic resolver, fatigue), `resolve` (the possession loop), `stream` (`MatchEvent` schema + commentary rendering) |
| `development` | Phase-3 growth engine (`DEVELOPMENT_MODEL.md` §2–§5): the `DevKnobs` table (sibling of `match_engine::Knobs`), the per-category age envelope, PA-scaled targets, `resolve_dev_profile`/`resolve_coaching` (worldgen edge), and `tick_changes` — the growth math producing a `DevelopmentTick`'s resolved deltas. The per-attribute rate law is factored into `attr_rate`, shared verbatim with `valuation`'s projection so there is one law (no second integrator to drift). All RNG/math lives here; `apply` only integer-adds via `apply_attr_step` |
| `valuation` | Phase-4 centralized value function (`TRANSFER_MODEL.md` §2): `value` / `value_all` (the §2.7 per-window `BTreeMap<PlayerId, Money>` cache), `project_ca` (runs `development::attr_rate` forward, jitter off, minutes/coaching neutral), `project_ca_batch` (many players, one shared knob-derived `DevTables` — `club_ai::observe`'s per-squad projection), the `ValueKnobs` §9 table (plausibility-picked, sibling of `DevKnobs`), and `MarketContext` (bounded league-wide role scarcity). `value_with` integrates each player's whole 0..=horizon_years trajectory in one pass (`project_ca_series`) rather than once per year — same numbers, no redundant re-integration of the shared prefix. A pure Layer-2 function — prices, never decides; no market/club-AI here (Phase 4 §5–§6) |
| `career_arc` | Phase-3 career-arc harness (`DEVELOPMENT_MODEL.md` §6): the development sibling of `match_engine::calibrate`. Drives the real worldgen + development-fold pipeline over many seeds × a decade-plus and reports the §6 metrics (peak ages, PA attainment + tail, veteran decline slopes, wonderkid hit/flop) with per-seed spread. `bin/career_arc` is the runner; `career_arcs_are_in_a_believable_ballpark` is the wide-band regression guard. Harness plumbing, never fed back into `DevKnobs` by itself — the re-fit is a human reading the numbers |
| `finance` | Phase-4 finance tick (`TRANSFER_MODEL.md` §4): `finance_deltas` resolves monthly revenue (∝ `Club.reputation`) minus the monthly share of committed wages into per-club deltas; `FinanceKnobs` (plausibility-picked, sibling of `DevKnobs`/`ValueKnobs`). RNG-free — both inputs are already-resolved world state, unlike `tick_changes`'s jitter. `commands::dev_ticks_between` calls it on the same 30-day boundary crossing `DevelopmentTick` fires on, emitting `Event::FinanceTick` alongside it |
| `pool` | Phase-4 player-pool lifecycle (`TRANSFER_MODEL.md` §8): `summer_pool_events` — one `YouthIntake` per club with roster headroom (reusing `worldgen::gen_player` with a 16-18 age band, quality anchored on `reputation` × `coaching_milli`), then every qualifying `PlayerRetired` (age ≥ `min_retirement_age` and best-role CA below `relevance_floor`, or a full season unsigned via `GameState::unsigned_since`). `PoolKnobs` (plausibility-picked, sibling of the others — but re-tuned against a real 15-season run, not left at a naive guess: the aging law lets CA plateau rather than crash, so a too-low floor leaves veterans immortal, squads permanently full, and mean age climbing unchecked). Intake is capped to `squad_max` headroom so it can never walk a club through the market's own hard squad-bound stabilizer. `commands::transfer_window_events` calls it only on the summer (even) window index, before `market::resolve_window`, so new prospects are on the books and retirees are already excluded from valuation when the clearing loop runs |
| `rng` | Seeded xoshiro256** + `derive_stream` — the crate's only source of randomness |
| `schedule` | `double_round_robin()` — deterministic fixture generation |
| `worldgen` | `generate()` — seeded new-game world/schedule/start date, recorded once into `GameStarted` |

`match_engine`'s trace (`MatchOutcome::stream`) is a Trace, not a fold input
(`MATCH_MODEL.md` §7): `commands::advance_matchday` folds only the score into
`Event::MatchPlayed` and discards the stream; nothing here persists it. Live-viewing
consumers reach the trace two ways: `fforge-game`'s friendly viewer calls `play_match`
directly (unrecorded, no `Event` at all), while its main game loop calls
`commands::player_match_preview` on the pre-advance `GameState` to get the human's own
fixture's trace, then executes `Command::AdvanceMatchday` as normal — same inputs, same
RNG derivation, so the previewed trace's score can never disagree with what gets
recorded.

`lib.rs` re-exports the public surface; consumers (`fforge-game`) import from the crate
root.

## Invariants to preserve

1. **All randomness is seed-derived.** Every `Rng` comes from `rng::derive_stream(seed,
   tag)`. Never construct a shared/global `Rng`, never seed from system entropy or wall-
   clock time — that breaks the same-seed-same-season guarantee the test suite checks.
2. **`GameState::apply` (and therefore `replay`) is a total, pure fold.** No RNG, no I/O,
   no wall-clock branching inside it. All impure work — RNG draws, match simulation,
   validation — happens in `commands::step`, which only *produces* `Event`s for `apply`
   to consume.
